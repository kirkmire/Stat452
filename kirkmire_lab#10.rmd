Homework[1]: In the basic data sets of R is the data set called state.x77 . Find an
optimum reduced model, using life expectancy (Life Ex) as response variable.
A partial picture of the data set information is shown below,

```{r}
#Relationship between Pairs#
state.x77

rel.state<-state.x77

colnames(rel.state)<-c('Population','Income','Illiteracy',"LifeExp","Murder","HSGrad","Frost","Area")

library(GGally)
ggpairs(rel.state)


```
