Homework [1]: Do a lattice view of all pairs (use pairs(babies)) and find correlations of all variables (cor(babies) or, more properly cor(tmp)), as well as read the description of variables used in this data. Make a FULL MODEL of (only) the
variables you think might be influencing baby weigh (wt). Describe what and why and
how you did what you did. List the full model with beta values and model summary().
Comment on your full model.
```{r}
library("UsingR")
babies<-babies

notthese<-(babies$gestation==999 | (babies$age==99)) | (babies$inc==98)
tmp<-babies[!notthese,c("gestation","age","wt","inc")]
library(GGally)
ggpairs(tmp)

help(babies)






```
