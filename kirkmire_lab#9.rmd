Homework [1]: Using your full model from last week's babies data from the UsingR package, find a reduced model using AIC analysis and compare with your model reduced using partial-F tests.

```{r}
library("UsingR")
babies<-babies

notthese<-(babies$gestation==999 | (babies$age==99)) | (babies$inc==98)
tmp<-babies[!notthese,1:23]

babywt.lm<-lm(wt~gestation+ht+number+time+wt1+parity+date+marital,data=tmp)

library(MASS)
stepAIC(babywt.lm)
```

Homework [2]: Take some quality time and analyze the example problem as well as the listing of techniques and R commands, pondering approaches, techniques and conclusions. Then write about 50 words saying what might be useful or not useful for
you in what you see.

Homework [3]: You did an interaction plot in lab 7 on factors of the ratanxiety.csv data. Redo the interaction plot using the command interaction.plot() and
compare the results.
